## For Telemetry 
After above tests, verify corresponding entries in Application Insight portal.
- For develop build, verify in `vscode maven telemetry test`.
- For RC build, verify in `vscode maven telemetry prod`.

#### Verification
* For extension activation and each command executed, verify:
    1. There are records named `vscjava.vscode-maven/opStart` and `vscjava.vscode-maven/opEnd` with same `customDimensions.operationId`, `customDimensions.operationName`
    2. In `opEnd`, check `customDimensions.errorCode`
        1. 0 for no error.
        2. Non-zero values indicate there's an error, check `message`, `stack`, `errorType` in `customDimensions`.
        3. For non-zero values, there should be an extra record `vscjava.vscode-maven/error` carrying the same error information.
* For command `Generate from Maven Archetype`, verify: 
    1. Records named `vscjava.vscode-maven/opStep` are sent after each step is executed. 
    2. For some steps, an extra `vscjava.vscode-maven/info` is sent carrying information. E.g.:
